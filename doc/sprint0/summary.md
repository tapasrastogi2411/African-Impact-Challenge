## Project Objective

  
- Build a platform to help new and aspiring African entrepreneurs in the Preincubation and Incubation stages of the African Impact Challenge. In particular, a community that facilitates seamless interaction between the different users of the system should be created. Furthermore, there should be an e-learning component enabling teachers to interact with and deliver content to the entrepreneurs.


## Key Users

- Aspiring African entrepreneurs: These are the people who have registered for the African Impact Challenge with the goal of receiving the capital, resources and guidance necessary to launch a start-up which aims to solve critical problems with technology.

  - Founder entrepreneurs: Entrepreneurs that have founded/co-founded a company. These entrepreneurs have higher company-based privileges than other entrepreneurs in the same company.

- Teachers: The people who will be providing training material/content, workshops and mentorship to the aspiring entrepreneurs.

- Partners (investors, service providers and corporations): The people/businesses providing additional resources and services to support the start-up companies participating in the African Impact Challenge. We group the different types of partners into one category since they all act in the same way in our application.

- Administrators: These people have the highest level of privilege on the website. They are responsible for granting permission to teachers and partners to join the website.



## Key Use Cases and Scenarios:


- Profile creation
	-    Each category of user can create an account/profile with permissions, views and functionality that is specific to their role.
    
	-   Founding entrepreneurs can create a profile for the company they founded. They also have the ability to upload resources to the company profile for partners to view.
    
	-   After teachers and partners register to use the website, they must be approved by an administrator to gain access to it.
    
	-   Specific key functionality for the other users are listed in the below points

- E-learning functionality
   
	-   Teachers can post instructional videos for entrepreneurs to watch and assignments to complete by a specified due date.
	    
	-   Teachers can hold live workshops.
	    
	-   Individual entrepreneurs can consume the content mentioned in the previous points. They should be able to easily contact the teachers regarding any questions they have about the videos and assignments.

- Social media functionality that enables interaction between different users of the application.
    
	-   Partners may want to contact entrepreneurs regarding their company. For example, an investor may have viewed the pitch deck uploaded by a company and may be interested in contacting the founder(s) of the company regarding investment inquiries.
    
	-   Users have the ability to directly message other users.



## Key Principles

Prioritize:

-   Quality over quantity when it comes to implementing features. For example, implementing 5 high quality features is better than implementing 10 mediocre features.
    
-   Making features user-friendly even if it incurs a performance cost.
    
-   Collaboration-based features since this is a primary weakness of the existing Google Classroom solution. Furthermore, it is also a high-valued feature as indicated by the product owner and thus user-stories pertaining to collaboration should have a high priority.
