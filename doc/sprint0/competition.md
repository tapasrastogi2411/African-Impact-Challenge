**Main Competitor: Google Classroom**

-   Current solution the product owner uses for the community + e-learning components of the African Impact Challenge.
    
     **Problems and Proposed Solutions**

       -   Not tailored to the specific needs of the product owner. The product owner is forced to work within the boundaries of Google Classroom and cannot add any desired features he wants. However, since we are designing the product from scratch, we have the ability to tailor the product to the product ownersâ€™ specific needs.
     

     -   Google Classroom is solely an e-learning platform. Thus, the only entities are students and teachers. Because of this, interactions within the application are limited to student-teacher relationships. However, the product requires 4 different entities: entrepreneurs, companies, partners and teachers. Interaction within the product should involve all four entities. Student-teacher relationship is only one out of various different relationships that should exist within the product. For example, entrepreneur-company and company-partner are two essential relationships that the product should have. The product we develop will include all 4 entities along with the appropriate relationships between them.
    

    -   If users are not familiar with the Google ecosystem, then using Google Classroom may not be user-friendly and intuitive to them. Our product will aim to have a user interface that is intuitive to all users, regardless of what online ecosystem they are a part of.


**Quercus**

-   Can be used to implement the elearning component of the product. Contains integration with Piazza and BBCollaborate which together provides a rich learning experience for students and teachers. However, using this as a solution runs into the same problems as with Google Classroom. Namely, the product needs to support more entities and relationships than what is provided by Quercus and by extension, other elearning platforms.


**Discord and Slack**

-   Partners currently use Zoom+Slack to communicate with companies outside of Google Classroom. The product we are developing aims to combine the elearning functionality provided by Google Classroom with the community functionality provided by Zoom+Slack. This integration should remove the need for partners to use external applications like Zoom+Slack to communicate with the companies. Discord is also listed along with Slack since they are both similar applications that accomplish the same goal.
