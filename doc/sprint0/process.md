## Decision Making 

-   Note that user story related decision making such as how to prioritize and assign story points to user stories are described in later sections.
    

 
-   To make general decisions such as what technology stack to use, the following framework is used: First, the team must decide what the various options to decide on are. Once the options are outlined, they are posted by a team member in the Discord chat. Next, everyone votes by reacting to the option they prefer. If an option has a clear majority, then that option is chosen. However, if there is a large amount of variance in the results, we discuss why everyone chose the option they chose and voting is done again. This process of voting -> high result variance -> discussion is repeated until a voting option has a clear majority in which case it is picked as the option to go with.


## Story Point Estimation

-   To assign story points to user stories we will use the planning poker technique. The website: [https://planningpokeronline.com/](https://planningpokeronline.com/) will be used to simulate the technique. The familiar Fibonacci sequence will be used for the estimation scale. The assigning of story points to user stories in the product backlog will be done after the termination of sprint0 and before the start of sprint1 during the release planning meeting.
    

## User Story Prioritization

  

-   To prioritize user stories into high/medium/low priority we start by using the Kano model to classify user stories as basic expectations, satisfiers and delighters. To achieve this, we first put ourselves in the shoes of the persona associated with the user story. We then will formulate functional/dysfunctional questions associated with the user story and answer them from the perspective of the persona. Based on the responses we come up with, we will classify the user story into one of the three categories listed above.
    

-   The user stories that we classify as basic expectations will be assigned a high priority since their absence will definitely leave the users deeply unsatisfied. All basic expectation user stories should be completed before satisfiers and delighters. For the first 3 sprints we will give satisfiers a medium priority and delighters a low priority. During the last sprint, if all basic expectations are completed and satisfiers have been completed to a reasonable degree, then we will prioritize completing delighters over satisfiers.
    
-   When choosing between a user-story of the same priority but different complexity (story points), prioritize the one with the lower complexity (story points).
    

 
## Meeting Plan 

During sprint0 we held meetings as the need arose since there were no Agile-type meetings (i.e. standups, release planning, sprint planning and sprint retrospective). During the beginning and middle of the sprint we occasionally met. However, the week before the sprint termination, more frequent meetings were held. The structure of the meetings was outlined in a Google Doc created by one of the team members. Initial meetings held were used to gain a better understanding of project requirements. These meetings included discussion of what project option to choose, expectations set out by the product owner, how to collaborate on the deliverables and what tech stack to use. Later meetings were dedicated to working on the deliverables such as designing a prototype of the website on Figma and working on the product backlog.

## Next phase: Lessons for the Future

A key problem in sprint0 was that a small number of people did most of the work early on whereas the rest of the group waited until 3 days before the deadline to start working. If this behavior continues in the future, it will result in a burndown chart that slowly decreases at the beginning of the sprint with steep decline near the end, which is not ideal. In other words, very little work is done at the beginning of the sprint and most of the work is done near the end. To remedy this, the team should all aim to spend at least an hour a day working on the project to ensure that gradual progress is made throughout the sprint rather than near the end.
